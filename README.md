<a href='https://adventofcode.com/'>Advent of Code</a> (AoC) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. The difficulty and subject matter of the puzzle varies throughout each event, but generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time.
<br>
These are my AoC puzzle solutions for 2022. 

Not all solutions are available and new solutions may be added infrequently, as I solve these in my free time. I participate in AoC for the enjoyment and satisfaction of solving puzzles, not to achieve 1st on the leaderboard. I like to learn new programming concepts and write code more efficiently.

## Running locally

### Here's the rundown of the solution environment.

**Programming Language:** Python

**Version:** 3.7+

**IDE:** Jupyter Notebooks


### Here's the rundown of the directory.

**Folder:** DayX

 >**Input:** DayX.txt

 >**Solution:** DayX_1_2.ipynb

Each folder contains the input in .txt form and the solution file with at least 1 part of the puzzle finished (each day's puzzle has 2 parts).

I don't have an environment prepared for you so you'd have to install the package dependencies as needed.
